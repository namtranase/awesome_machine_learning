# K Nearest Neighbor algorithm

## Idea
K Nearest Neighbor is supervised learning. In fact, the KNN algorithm doesn't learn anything, it simple to remember all dataset. KNN also is called `lazy learning`. Every computation is calculated when need output of new input. KNN can be use in classification and regression problem. The label of one point data is interpreted from K nearest point around it.
