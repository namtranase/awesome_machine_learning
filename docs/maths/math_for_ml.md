## Linear vs Affine
1. Explain
A linear function fixes the origin, whereas an affine function need not do so. An affine function is the composition of a linear function with a translation, so while the linear part fixes the origin, the translation can map it somewhere else.

Linear functions between vector spaces preserve the vector space structure (so in particular they must fix the origin). While affine functions don't preserve the origin, they do preserve some of the other geometry of the space, such as the collection of straight lines.
